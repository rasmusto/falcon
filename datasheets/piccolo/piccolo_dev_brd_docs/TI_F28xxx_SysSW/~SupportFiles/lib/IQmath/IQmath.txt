Thank you for trying C28x IQmath Library. 
IQmath Library is installed in C:\TIDCS\C28\IQMATH directory.

Please read the README.TXT file (C:TIDC\C28\IQMATH\README.TXT) for specific details of 
current IQmath library release.

Texas Instruments TMS320C28x IQmath Library is collection of highly optimized and 
high precision mathematical Function Library for C/C++ programmers to seamlessly port 
the floating-point algorithm into fixed point code on TMS320C28x devices. These routines 
are typically used in computationally intensive real-time applications where optimal 
execution speed & high accuracy is critical. By using these routines you can achieve 
execution speeds considerable faster than equivalent code written in standard ANSI C language. 
In addition, by providing ready-to-use high precision functions, TI IQmath library can 
shorten significantly your DSP application development time.
